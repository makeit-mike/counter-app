More or less this is simply me fumbling around in a new framework. Learning how React works, and seeing if it is something I want to invest actual time into.

The end goal of this app is an item cart that you will be able to add and remove items from a cart using a counter.

The counter will be a React component, and there will be another componet Cart that will hold items in the cart that have counters.

That's the idea anyway.

rule: only allowed to use React and Bootstrap.
